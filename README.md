## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media query

### What I learned

I've learned how to work with flexbox in order to center the main container, also be more accure working with just an image and get the correct position and desgin for each element.

### Continued development

I would like to continuous learning on flexbox and how connect different elements inside of them.
